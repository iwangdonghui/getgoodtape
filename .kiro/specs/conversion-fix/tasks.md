# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Fix Core Progress Tracking System
  - Diagnose and fix the progress update mechanism in ConversionService that causes jobs to stick at 0%
  - Ensure progress updates are atomic and properly propagated through the system
  - Implement proper error handling for progress update failures
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_

- [ ] 2. Implement Robust Job State Management
  - Fix race conditions in job status transitions that prevent proper processing
  - Implement proper job locking mechanism to prevent duplicate processing attempts
  - Add job timeout detection and recovery for stuck jobs
  - Create comprehensive job state validation and cleanup procedures
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 4.1, 4.2_

- [ ] 3. Fix WebSocket Real-time Communication
  - Diagnose and repair WebSocket progress notification system
  - Implement connection recovery and retry logic for failed WebSocket connections
  - Add proper error handling for WebSocket message delivery failures
  - Ensure progress updates reach frontend clients consistently
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.3_

- [ ] 4. Implement Platform-Specific Error Handling
  - Create comprehensive error classification system for different failure types
  - Implement YouTube-specific error detection and user-friendly messaging
  - Ensure Twitter/X and other stable platforms maintain reliable conversion performance
  - Add platform-specific fallback strategies and recovery mechanisms
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 3.1, 3.2, 4.3, 4.4, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4_

- [ ] 5. Add Comprehensive Diagnostic and Health Check System
  - Implement end-to-end health check endpoints for all system components
  - Create diagnostic tools to identify bottlenecks in frontend, Workers API, or backend processing
  - Add detailed error logging and monitoring for conversion failures
  - Implement system status reporting for external dependencies
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 6. Implement Conversion Result Caching and Storage Optimization
  - Add caching mechanism for successful conversions to avoid reprocessing identical requests
  - Implement reliable file storage and download URL management
  - Add automatic download URL refresh for expired links
  - Ensure robust backup storage solutions for file persistence
  - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4_

- [ ] 7. Create Automated Testing Suite for Conversion Pipeline
  - Write unit tests for ConversionService progress tracking and job management
  - Create integration tests for end-to-end conversion flow with progress verification
  - Implement platform-specific tests for Twitter, YouTube, and other platforms
  - Add performance tests for concurrent conversion handling and WebSocket scalability
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 6.1, 6.2_

- [ ] 8. Implement Enhanced Error Recovery and Retry Logic
  - Add intelligent retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for network failures
  - Implement queue management and load balancing for processing service overload
  - Create alternative access methods for platform restrictions
  - Add automatic quality reduction fallback for timeout issues
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_
