# Requirements Document

## Introduction

GetGoodTape's conversion functionality is currently in a broken state, with all platform conversions stuck at 0% progress. We need to immediately diagnose and fix the core conversion pipeline to ensure users can successfully use the video conversion service.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to successfully convert Twitter/X platform videos, so that I can obtain the required audio or video files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user submits Twitter/X video link THEN system SHALL correctly extract video metadata
2. WHEN system starts converting Twitter video THEN progress SHALL advance normally from 0% to 100%
3. WHEN conversion completes THEN user SHALL be able to successfully download the converted file
4. IF Twitter access is restricted THEN system SHALL provide clear error messages and resolution suggestions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the conversion process to provide real-time progress feedback, so that I can understand the conversion status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conversion starts THEN system SHALL immediately display initial progress (>0%)
2. WHEN conversion is in progress THEN progress SHALL update regularly and reflect actual processing status
3. WHEN conversion encounters problems THEN system SHALL provide specific error information
4. IF conversion times out THEN system SHALL automatically retry or provide alternative solutions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to quickly diagnose the root cause of conversion failures, so that I can fix issues promptly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conversion fails THEN system SHALL record detailed error logs
2. WHEN diagnosing issues THEN system SHALL provide end-to-end health check tools
3. WHEN bottlenecks are discovered THEN system SHALL identify whether the issue is in frontend, Workers API, or backend processing service
4. IF external dependencies fail THEN system SHALL have backup processing solutions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the conversion system to have robust error recovery capabilities, so that it can work normally under various exceptional circumstances.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network connection is unstable THEN system SHALL automatically retry failed requests
2. WHEN processing service is overloaded THEN system SHALL have queue management and load balancing
3. WHEN platform access is restricted THEN system SHALL attempt alternative access methods
4. IF all methods fail THEN system SHALL provide user-friendly error messages and suggestions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle videos from various mainstream platforms, so that I can meet different conversion needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user submits YouTube link THEN system SHALL be able to bypass anti-bot detection
2. WHEN user submits TikTok link THEN system SHALL correctly handle short video formats
3. WHEN user submits Instagram link THEN system SHALL handle various media types
4. IF a platform is temporarily unavailable THEN system SHALL provide clear status information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want Twitter and other stable platforms to work reliably while YouTube issues are being resolved, so that I can still use the service for most conversion needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user submits Twitter/X link THEN system SHALL process conversion successfully with minimal network issues
2. WHEN user submits TikTok, Instagram, or other non-YouTube links THEN system SHALL maintain stable conversion performance
3. WHEN YouTube conversion fails due to anti-bot detection THEN system SHALL clearly indicate this is a known YouTube-specific issue
4. IF YouTube access is temporarily blocked THEN system SHALL suggest using alternative platforms while fixes are implemented

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want converted files to be reliably stored and downloadable, so that I can access conversion results at any time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conversion completes THEN file SHALL be successfully uploaded to cloud storage
2. WHEN user clicks download THEN download link SHALL be valid and file complete
3. WHEN download link expires THEN system SHALL automatically generate new valid link
4. IF storage service fails THEN system SHALL have backup storage solutions
